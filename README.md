- **Correct first error notification logic**
: The original logic doesnt send notification message when the watched website was down from the start.

# "watchmen", HTTP monitor for node.js

  - "watchmen" monitors HTTP servers by sending GET or POST pings (HTTP requests) in pre-defined intervals.
  - You can check for a) certain status code or b) a certain text in the response stream.
  - If site is down, you will get a notification. Once the service is up again you get another notification (just email transport protocol for now by using postmark). You define notifications recipients per url, host or application level.

There is a <a href="http://letsnode.com/example-of-what-node-is-really-good-at" target="_blank">related blog post about watchmen here</a>.

# Demo

You can see an online demo of how watchmen control panel looks <a href="http://letsnode.com:8084" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Installation

Watchmen depends on the following modules:

 - [colors](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js)
 - [ejs](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs)
 - [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express)
 - [node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis)

Make sure you install those dependencies by issuing the command:

		$ npm install

## Configuration
  
  Edit config.js:
  
  a) **Define hosts and url's to be monitored:**

		{
			name:'letsnode.com',
			host: 'letsnode.com',
			port:80, 
			ping_interval: one_minute, //set ping interval (in seconds)
			failed_ping_interval: one_minute, //set ping interval if site is down (in seconds)
			enabled: true, //enables/disables this host
			alert_to: ['ivan@iloire.com'], //emails to alert if site goes down.
			warning_if_takes_more_than: 700, //miliseconds. alert if request takes more than this
			urls : [
				{
					method: 'get', 
					url : '/', 
					//expected status code and expected string to be found in the response (otherwise will fail)
					expected: {statuscode: 200, contains: 'A blog about node.js and express.js'}
				}
			]
		}
  
  b) **Define Postmark and notifications settings:**

		exports.notifications = {
			Enabled: false, //if disabled, no email will be sent (just console messages)
			To: 'ivan@iloire.com',
			postmark : {
				From: 'ivan@iloire.com',
				Api_key : 'your-postmark-key-here'
			}
		} 

  c) **Run watchmen**

		$ node watchmen.js

  or more probably you would want to use **forever** to run it in the background

		$ forever start watchmen.js

  d) **Run the web app to display status reports**

		$ forever start webserver/app.js 3000 (where 3000 is the port you want to use).

  You can also run the tests by using

		$ node test/runtests.js
